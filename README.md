# Website Tailwind CSS Learning Project

This repository is a personal learning project where I practice web design and explore Tailwind CSS. It is not a complete or polished website, and it does not include full features — the focus is purely on learning and experimentation.

The project is structured as a real estate website example, giving me a playground to experiment with layouts, responsive design, and styling components. My goal is to improve my frontend skills while building something visually appealing, even if it is not fully functional.

**I created this project to:**
- Practice designing web pages from scratch
- Learn how to use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Experiment with layouts, components, and responsive design
- Apply theoretical knowledge in a practical sandbox environment

---

**Current Status**
- This project is not production-ready
- No backend or database functionality is implemented
- All content and features are for design practice only
- The focus is on learning CSS/Tailwind and building visually consistent components

**Note**
This repository is purely for personal study and practice.  
If you are also learning Tailwind CSS or web design, you may find some layout or styling examples useful, but this is not a finished project.
